Test runs and examples

All tests and examples are in the ./examples/ directory. The expected run times
are on a 3.6 GHz i7-3820 CPU (4 cores, 8 harware threads), using all available 
CPU cores [Not all examples benefit from parallel execution on this CPU]. 

Please keep in mind that the default configuration file (vanilla.mak) supplied
with the distribution emphasizes portability and robustness of the executable
over its performance. In particular, it enables neither the parallel (OpenMP) 
execution, nor advanced vectorization. All times shown below were obtained with
an optimized, OpenMP build (configuration file: configs/shelob-ifort_opt.mak).
An unoptimized, single-core build may result in execution wall-times longer
by a factor of 10x on the same hardware.

Sample inputs are in the the files with the *.inp extension; reference outputs 
are in matching *.out_ref files. For some of the examples, reference radial 
wavefunctions are in wfn/*.ref files.

To re-run all tests, use "run-all.sh". To clean up test results, use "clean.sh".
(Both scripts are in the ./examples/ subdirectory.)

The examples are:

* [E1] Resonant 1-photon 1S->2P_0 bound transition in atomic hydrogen, using 
  linearly polarized 1.45 fs Gaussian pulse at 0.1 TW/cm^2 (peak); uniform
  300-point radial grid.

  Input:      hydrogen_1S_2P0_uniform.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   2 seconds (double); 1 second (single); 4 minutes (quad)
  Reference:  hydrogen_1S_2P0_uniform.out_ref (main output)
              hydrogen_1S_2P0_uniform.out_refquad (main output, quad precision)
              wfn/H-1S-2Pz-WU-* (radial wavefunction)

  This example uses a uniform 300-point radial grid at 0.2 Bohr resolution.
  Relatively coarse uniform grid allows large time steps, so that the entire
  simulation takes 500 time steps. The accuracy is still quite good, with
  the H ground state computed at -0.500018 Hartree. 1S->2P0 excitation
  probability is 0.3099E-02. Single-precision version of the example gives
  a result accurate to 4 significant digits. Quad- and double-precision
  results agree to 12 digits.

  This example should be compared to [E2], which uses a much tighter grid.

* [E2] Resonant 1-photon 1S->2P_0 bound transition in atomic hydrogen, using 
  linearly polarized 1.45 fs Gaussian pulse at 0.1 TW/cm^2 (peak); log-uniform
  1000-point grid, grid spacing varies from 0.02 to 0.2 Bohr.

  Input:      hydrogen_1S_2P0.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   1 minute (double); 30 seconds (single); 2.5 hours (quad)
  Reference:  hydrogen_1S_2P0.out_ref (main output)
              hydrogen_1S_2P0.out_refquad (main output, quad precision)
              wfn/H-1S-2Pz-WL-* (radial wavefunction)

  Log-uniform grid leads to a less well-behaved Hamiltonian, necessitating
  a larger number of time steps (20000) to maintain numerical stability.
  The numerical accuracy is also higher, with the ground state at -0.4999933.
  1S->2P0 excitation probability is 0.30996E-02. Single-precision version
  of the example is accurate to 3 significant digits. Quad- and double-precision
  results agree to 12 digits.

* [E3] 1-photon ionization of hydrogen 2P_0 state, using Z-polarized 1.45 fs 
  pulse at 1TW/cm^2 (peak) and 13.6 eV central energy; log-uniform 1000-point 
  grid, spacing varies from 0.02 to 0.2 Bohr.

  Input:      hydrogen_2P0_ion.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   1 minute (double); 30 seconds (single); 3 hours (quad)
  Reference:  hydrogen_2P0_ion.out_ref (main output)
              hydrogen_2P0_ion.out_refquad (main output, quad precision)
              wfn/H-2Pz-WL-* (radial wavefunction)

  Total ionization probability in the S channel is 0.2023E-04; in the D channel
  0.1139E-03. Single-precision version of the example gives 3 significant digits
  in ionization probability. A weak 2-photon peak is also seen in P channel 
  (0.2657E-08 probability) and F channel (0.1318E-08 probability). Single-
  precision run reproduces these peaks, but also produces spurious peaks at the
  same probability level at higher energies. Quad- and double-precision
  results agree to 12 digits.

* [E4] 1-photon ionization of 3P_1 state of model Ar potential in the vicinity of
  Cooper minimum, using Z-polarized 1.45 fs pulse at 1TW/cm^2 (peak) and 46.3 eV;
  log-uniform 2000-point grid, spacing varies from 0.005 to 0.15 Bohr.

  Input:      argon_3P1_cooper.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   6 minutes (double); 2 minutes (single); 17 hours (quad)
  Reference:  argon_3P1_cooper.out_ref (main output)
              argon_3P1_cooper.out_refquad (main output, quad precision)
              wfn/Ar-2P1-Cooper-* (radial wavefunction)

  This example uses an effective potential designed to reproduce experimental
  one-electron removal energies in Argon atom. The 3P state of this potential
  is at -0.581373 Hartree; current grid gives -0.581416 Hartree. The photon
  energy is chosen near the Cooper minimum of this potential. The total ionization
  probability is 0.2875E-06 (all in the D channel). Note the characteristic 
  twinned profile of the 1-photon peak in the photoelectron spectrum.
  Single-precision version gives about 2 significant digits for the ionization 
  probability. Quad- and double-precision results agree to 12 digits.

  This example should be compared to [E5] below.

* [E5] 1-photon ionization of 3P_1 state of model Ar potential away from the Cooper
  minimum, using Z-polarized 1.45 fs pulse at 1TW/cm^2 (peak) and 55.0 eV

  Input:      argon_3P1_offcooper.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   6 minutes (double); 2 minutes (single); 18 hours (quad)
  Reference:  argon_3P1_offcooper.out_ref (main output)
              argon_3P1_offcooper.out_refquad (quadruple precision)
              wfn/Ar-2P1-Off-Cooper-* (radial wavefunction)

  This example is the same as [E4], except for the photon energy chosen about
  9 eV above the Cooper minimum. The total ionization probability is now
  3.3060E-06 (D channel). Single-precision version gives 2 significant digits
  in ionization probability.

  This example should be compared to [E4] above.

* [E6] 1-photon ionization of 3P_{-1} state of model Ar potential by left circularly
  polarized (XY polarization plane) 1.45 fs pulse at 30 eV and 2TW/cm^2;
  log-uniform 1400-point grid, spacing varies from 0.005 to 0.15 Bohr.

  Input:      argon_3P1m_circ_l.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   6 minutes (double); 3 minutes (single); 11 hours (quad)
  Reference:  argon_3P1m_circ_l.out_ref (main output)
              argon_3P1m_circ_l.out_refquad (quadruple precision)
              wfn/Ar-2P1m-circ_l-* (radial wavefunction, partial)

  This is a non-axially-symmetric weak-field example. The only open ionization
  channel is to L=2/M=-2 continuum. Calculated 1-photon ionization probability is 
  7.3674E-04. The 2-photon peak (in L=3/M=-3 continuum) is barely visible, with 
  ionization probability 3.460E-8.

  Single precision version is accurate to 2 significant digits for the 1-photon
  probability.

  This example should be compared to [E7] below.

* [E7] 1-photon ionization of 3P_{-1} state of model Ar potential by right circularly
  polarized (XY polarization plane) 1.45 fs pulse at 30 eV and 2TW/cm^2;
  log-uniform 1400-point grid, spacing varies from 0.005 to 0.15 Bohr.

  Input:      argon_3P1m_circ_r.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   6 minutes (double); 3 minutes (single); 12 hours (quad)
  Reference:  argon_3P1m_circ_r.out_ref (main output)
              argon_3P1m_circ_r.out_refquad (quadruple precision)
              wfn/Ar-2P1m-circ_r-* (radial wavefunction, partial)

  This example is nearly identical to [E6], except the laser pulse is now right
  circular-polarized. Now, the L=0/M=0 (3.4721E-4 probability) and L=2/M=0 
  (1.2282E-4 probability) channels are open for 1-photon ionization. 2-photon
  channels to L=1/M=1 (1.5152E-9 probability) and L=3/M=1 (2.3072E-9) are
  also visible. 

  Single-precision version gives 1-photon channels to 2 significant digits. 
  The 2-photon channel probability is not well reproduced.

* [E8] High-harmonics generation from 1S state of hydrogen atom by linearly-polarized
  4.84 fs 100 TW 800 nm pulse. Log-uniform 300-point grid, grid spacing varies from 
  0.04 to 0.4 Bohr. The simulation continues to 24.2 fs to let residual dipole ring 
  down.

  Input:      hydrogen_1S_hhg_linear.inp
              hydrogen_1S_hhg_linear.dhr (requires dyson_harmonics.x, not part of this package)
  Cores used: 8 (logical) / 4 (physical)
  Run time:   5 minutes (double); 12 hours (quad)
  Reference:  hydrogen_1S_hhg_linear.out_ref (main output)
              hydrogen_1S_hhg_linear.out_refquad (quadruple precision)
              hydrogen_1S_hhg_elliptical_spec.pdf (HHG power spectrum)

  This example illustrates simulation of a high-harmonics spectrum for a hydrogen
  atom subject to an linearly polarized field (ellipticity 0.1). The free-oscillation
  radius in this field is about 17 Bohr. Because the absorbing boundary starts at
  78 Bohr, contributions from both short and long trajectories are included.
  The expected harmonic cut-off is at 1.20 Hartree (32.7 eV; H21). 
  The final population within the box is 0.99166. Remaining population 
  of the 1S ground state is 0.98923. The HHG power spectrum can be derived by 
  Fourier-transforming the real part of the time-dependent dipole [in H-1S-hhg-lin.detail].
  The reference spectrum, showing \omega^4 |d_\omega|^2, is in 
  hydrogen_1S_hhg_elliptical_spec.pdf.

  This example experiences a nearly complete loss of significance in single precision.

  This example should be compared to [E10]

* [E9] Strong-field ionization of hydrogen 2P_0 state by 4.84 fs pulse at 800 nm and
  100 TW/cm^2 (peak); log-uniform 2200-point grid, spacing varies from 0.04 to 0.4 Bohr.

  Input:      hydrogen_2P0_sfi.inp
  Cores used: 4
  Run time:   40 minutes (double); 5 days (quad)
  Reference:  hydrogen_2P0_sfi.out_ref (main output)
              hydrogen_2P0_sfi.out_refquad (quadruple precision)
              hydrogen_2P0_sfi.pdf (ATI spectrum)

  This example calculates an ATI spectrum due to strong-field ionization by a short
  near-IR pulse. Due to the high field intensity, an extended angular grid is
  necessary to reach convergence (Lmax = 30 in this example). Because an extended
  radial grid is needed to prevent electron density reaching the boundary, the 
  radial grid is relatively coarse, and the initial 2P state has energy of
  -0.1250013. The 1S ground state is at -0.4999884H on this grid. The simulation 
  is still axially symmetric. 

  The pulse is sufficiently intense to nearly fully ionize the atom; the final 
  energy is 0.70073E-01 Hartree. Only 2.69% of the initial population is left
  in L=1 bound states; the most populated bound channel is L=3 (10.55%). The
  maximum of the continuum population is in L=4 channel (21.05%), with significant
  population (3.02E-04 probability) still present in L=15 continuum. The Up in
  this system is about 6 eV; the ATI peaks are seen up to 55 eV, consistent
  with the 10Up recollision plateau cut-off.

  This example experiences a nearly complete loss of significance in single precision.
  Single-precision is also -slower- due to repeated failures in the iterative
  linear solver, which must be resolved by falling back to a dense LAPACK solver.

* [E10] High-harmonics generation from 1S state of hydrogen atom by elliptically-polarized
  (Ey/Ez = 0.1) 4.84 fs 100 TW 800 nm pulse. Log-uniform 300-point grid, grid spacing
  varies from 0.04 to 0.4 Bohr. The simulation continues to 24.2 fs to let residual
  dipole ring down.

  Input:      hydrogen_1S_hhg_elliptical.inp
              hydrogen_1S_hhg_elliptical.dhr (requires dyson_harmonics.x, not part of the package)
  Cores used: 8 (logical) / 4 (physical)
  Run time:   1 hour (double); 3 days (quad)
  Reference:  hydrogen_1S_hhg_elliptical.out_ref (main output)
              hydrogen_1S_hhg_elliptical.out_refquad (quadruple precision)
              hydrogen_1S_hhg_elliptical_spec.pdf (HHG power spectrum)

  This example illustrates simulation of a high-harmonics spectrum for a hydrogen
  atom subject to an elliptically polarized field (ellipticity 0.1). The free-oscillation
  radius in this field is about 17 Bohr. Because the absorbing boundary starts at
  78 Bohr, contributions from both short and long trajectories are included.
  The expected harmonic cut-off is at 1.20 Hartree (32.7 eV; H21). 
  The final population within the box is 0.99177. Remaining population 
  of the 1S ground state is 0.98964. The HHG power spectrum can be derived by 
  Fourier-transforming the real part of the time-dependent dipole [in H-1S-hhg-ell.detail].
  The reference spectrum, showing \omega^4 |d_\omega|^2, is in hydrogen_1S_hhg_elliptical.pdf.

  This example experiences a nearly complete loss of significance in single precision.

  This example should be compared to [E8]
