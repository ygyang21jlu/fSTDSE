 - Added evaluation of the dipole-acceleration expectation value for
   multiplicative effective potentials.

   The implementation of dipole acceleration (subroutine wt_dipole in
   wavefunction_tools.f90) requires gradient of the effective interation
   potential. The gradient is calculated in initialize_channel_potentials
   (spherical_data.f90) by numerical differentiation of the user-supplied
   potential. Numerical differentiation step is controlled by the parameter
   SD_RGRID_GRAD_DELTA.
